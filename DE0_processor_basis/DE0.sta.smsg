Warning: Ignored assignments for entity "DE0_Default" -- entity does not exist in design
Critical Warning: Synopsys Design Constraints File file not found: 'DE0.sdc'. A Synopsys Design Constraints File is required by the TimeQuest Timing Analyzer to get proper timing constraints. Without it, the Compiler will not properly optimize the design.
Critical Warning: The following clock transfers have no clock uncertainty assignment. For more accurate results, apply clock uncertainty assignments or use the derive_clock_uncertainty command.
Critical Warning: Timing requirements not met
Critical Warning: Found minimum pulse width or period violations. See Report Minimum Pulse Width for details.
